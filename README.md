# Connect 4 Assistant (Refurbished)

A JavaFX desktop app that helps play/analyze Connect 4. Refurbished from an older high-school project and updated to run cleanly with Gradle + JavaFX.

## Requirements
- Java 21+
- Uses the Gradle wrapper, so no separate Gradle install is required.

## Run
### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
.\gradlew run
```

### macOS / Linux
```terminal
chmod +x gradlew
./gradlew run
```
